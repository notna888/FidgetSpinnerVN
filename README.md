# FidgetSpinnerVN
This is the Fidget Spinner Virtual Novel that was 100% a joke, but I actually started making, and that I'm pulling others in to help me on this



The idea of it came together in January of 2018 in the CSSC

Anton started working on it, but didn't get very far because he got a full time job and junk
